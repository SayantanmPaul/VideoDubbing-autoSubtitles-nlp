Let's start with a few jaw dropping numbers about the production.

00:03.760 --> 00:08.520
The film had 177 animators on staff at one point.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.480
More than twice the typical animated film.

00:11.480 --> 00:16.880
To put that in perspective, the original Toy Story had just 27 animators.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.200
It took one week to animate just one second of footage.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.080
It usually takes a week for four seconds.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.520
It actually took them one year to get just 10 seconds they were happy with.

00:29.520 --> 00:30.560
Very cool.
